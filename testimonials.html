				<p>"Thank you, Annette, for you time. You said you would get the information on the 12th and that is when I received it. Good communication, very pleasant."</p>
				<hr>
				<p>"Annette Polsky has been wonderful to work with, the amount of information she has been able to research has given more than satisfying results. She accomplished far more than I anticipated in the finds of me ancestors. Annette worked very quickly as I had a time line for the results which I needed for a trip to Ireland. She was so patience with me and my questions and lack of knowledge when it came to this complicated process. I can't thank her enough, the fee for her service was more than fair for the amount of information I have received. I would certainly use Annette's services in the future. Sincerely, Susan"</p>
				<hr>
				<p>"Very diligent and easy to work with. She went above and beyond conducting a simple check and devoted a significant effort toward the research objective. Thank you!"</p>

				<p>"Annette worked wonders. I am really glad with the progress this project has gotten, I felt Annette was reliable, trustworthy and very professional! I can't wait to hire her again in the near future."</p> 
				<hr>
				<p>"I didn't really know what to expect either with the expert Annette, or with the process and service. WOW! I could never have retrieved all the information and clear path to a village, a church, and all those relatives, both here and those who remained in Ireland. If there's a way for me to attempt a visit to Moylaugh&mdash;I now know that's where I need to go, and it's thanks to the thoroughness of this expert. What a wonderful service. When I return&mdash;I will look to reconnect with Annette through you to do the same about my grandfather's history&mdash;have more facts here. Thank you so very much. JMolek"</p>
				<hr>
